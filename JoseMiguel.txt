Welcome! My name is<span id="k"> José Miguel González Domínguez</span>. <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>I used to work as a lawyer, but since I have allways loved technology and knowing how things work, I decided to change my life and I've recently finished a nine week coding bootcamp in Le Wagon Madrid.</p>
<!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->
<p>The program covers from the foundations of <span id="b">Ruby</span> to <span id="b">Rails</span> framework, including <span id="b">HTML</span>, <span id="b">CSS</span>, <span id="b">JavaScript</span>, <span id="b">Heroku</span> and <span id="b">Databases</span>. I put all this knowledge in practice on the final proyect, working in a team and using <span id="b">Scrum</span> methodology.</p><!-- kjdhjhgdgldjhgdwtoiewotwotjdfkjdfffsf -->
<p>The proyect was 'gigs!', a web app to search for concerts based on location or genre, discover indie bands listening to his spotify directly from the app and buy tickets. We buildt the app from scratch, and I worked with my team in all the stages, from the <span id="d">Figma</span> mockup to deployment.<br><br><br>If you wanna see the app just go to <a href="https://www.live-gigs.live/"> gigs!</a>.</p><!-- hsdgfhjfkdjhfkjsdhfkjdshfkjsdhfkjsdhkfjhdskjfhksdjhfkdsj -->
