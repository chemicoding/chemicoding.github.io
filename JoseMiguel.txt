Welcome! My name is José Miguel González Domínguez.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>I've recently finished a nine week coding bootcamp in Le Wagon Madrid.</p>
<p>I love coding, solving problems and technology in general, i am a fast learner allways willing to know more about how things work</p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->
<p> I learned to develop a full functioning web application from scratch. The program covers from the foundations of Ruby to Rails framework, including Html, CSS, JavaScript, Heroku and databases. I put all this knowdledge in practice on the final proyect, working in  a team and using Scrum methodology.</p><!-- kjdhjhgdgldjhgdwtoiewotwotjdfkjdfffsf -->
<p>My final proyect in Le Wagon was 'gigs!', a web app to search for concerts based on location, discover indie bands listening to his spotify directly from the app and buy tickets.
